=How does a client-server app source code look like?=

=== Eliom client-server applications

Eliom client-server applications are running in your browser for a <<a_manual project="eliom" chapter="clientserver-applications"|certain lifetime>> and consist of one or several pages/URLs.
An application has its associated js file, which must have the same name ([[wiki(72):howto/compile|generated automatically by the default makefile]] and added automatically by Eliom in the page).

For example, we define an application called //example//:
<<code language="ocaml"|
module Example =
  Eliom_registration.App
    (struct
      let application_name = "example"
     end)
>>

=== Eliom Services

Pages are generated by //services//. Here is how to define a service:

<<code language="ocaml"|
let main =
  Eliom_service.service
    ~path:[]
    ~get_params:unit
    ()
>>

The path is a list of string corresponding to the url. Here, the list is empty because it's the main page.

If, for example, the list is ["hello";"world"], the page will be accessed using the address:
<<code|http://website.com/hello/world/>>

More informations about parameters: [[wiki:manual/how-to-use-get-parameters-or-parameters-in-the-url|How to use GET parameters (parameters in the URL)?]]

Now that our service has been declared, we associate to it an OCaml function that will generate the page. We call this //service registration//. If the service belongs to the application, we use the registrations functions from module {{{Example}}} defined above.

<<code language="ocaml"|
let _ =
  Example.register
    ~service:main
    (fun () () ->
      Lwt.return ...)
>>

The third parameter is the function that will be called to generate the page.
This function takes two parameters, corresponding respectively to GET and POST parameters. Here both are {{{()}}} because the service does not take any parameter. The function returns an element of type html (using Lwt).


=== Page Content

The content of Eliom application pages is made using functions.
The **html function** takes two parameters:
head and body, which are also functions that takes parameters coresponding to their content.

<<code language="ocaml"|
(html
           (head (title (pcdata "Page Title")) [])
           (body [p [pcdata "Hello World!"]])))
>>

Most of the elements functions take a list of other elements as a parameter.

Validity of HTML is checked at compile time, which means that a program
that may generate a page that does not respect the recommendations of the
W3C will be rejected at compile time.
