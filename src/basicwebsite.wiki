//The code of this tutorial has been tested against Eliom 4.// \\

<<wip|This tutorial is work in progress. Please send us any mistake or comment./>>

In this tutorial, we will show how to use the Ocsigen framework
(mainly Eliom) to write a lightweight Web site by generating pages
using OCaml functions. The goal is to show that using Eliom is
possible even if you don't need all the features (for example if you
don't want HTML typing or client side features). Besides, this will
make possible to extend your Web site in a full Web application
if you want, later. This tutorial is also a good overview of the basics
of Eliom.


==@@id="service"@@ A service generating a page==

The following code shows how to create a service that will answer
for requests at URL {{{http://.../aaa/bbb}}}, by calling the following
Ocaml function {{{f}}}:

<<code language="ocaml" |

 f : (string * string) list -> unit -> string Lwt.t

>>

{{{f}}} generates HTML as a string, taking as argument
the list of URL parameters (GET parameters).

<<code language="ocaml" |

let f _ () =
  Lwt.return "<html><head><title>A</title></head><body>B</body></html>"

let main_service =
  Eliom_registration.Html_text.register_service
    ~path:["aaa"; "bbb"]
    ~get_params:Eliom_parameter.any
    f

>>

{{{Eliom_paramer.any}}} means that the service takes any GET parameter.

We recommend to use the program {{{eliom-distillery}}}
to generate a template for your application (a Makefile and a default
configuration file for Ocsigen Server).


<<code language="shell"|
$ eliom-distillery -name mysite -template basic -target-directory mysite
>>

Put these lines in file {{{mysite.eliom}}}, compile and run the server by
doing:

<<code language="shell"|
$ make test.byte
>>

Your page is now available at URL [[http://localhost:8080/aaa/bbb|{{{http://localhost:8080/aaa/bbb}}}]].

If you dont want to use the Makefile provided by eliom-distillery,
just replace {{{mysite.eliom}}} by a file {{{mysite.ml}}},
compile and run with

<<code language="shell"|
$ ocamlfind ocamlc -package eliom.server -thread -c mysite.ml
$ ocsigenserver -c mysite.conf
>>

where mysite.conf is adapted from
 {{{local/etc/mysite/mysite-test.conf}}}
by replacing mysite.cma by your cmo.

==@@id="post"@@ POST service==

Services using the POST HTTP method are created using the function
<<a_api project="eliom" | val Eliom_service.Http.post_service >>.
To create a service with POST parameters, first you must create
a service without POST parameters and then the service with POST
parameters, with the first service as fallback. The fallback will be used
if the user comes back later without POST parameters, for example
because he put a bookmark on this URL.

<<code language="ocaml"|

let g getp postp = Lwt.return "..."

let post_service =
  Eliom_registration.Html_text.register_post_service
    ~fallback:main_service
    ~post_params:Eliom_parameter.any
    g
>>

==@@id="misc"@@ Going further==

That's probably all you need for a basic Web site in OCaml.

Have a look at Eliom's API documentation to see other kinds of services,
for example <<a_api project="eliom" subproject="server"| module Eliom_registration.Redirection>>
to create HTTP redirections.

Instead of generating HTML in OCaml strings, we highly recommend to use
//typed HTML//. It is very easy to use (once you have learned the basics)
and helps a lot to efficiently write modular and valid HTML.

Eliom also has a way to typecheck forms and GET or POST parameters.
By giving a description of the parameters your service expects,
Eliom will check their presence automatically, and convert them
for you to OCaml types.

Eliom also has other ways to identify services (rather than just the PATH
in the URL). For example Eliom can identify a service just by a parameter
(whatever the path is). This is called //non-attached coservices// and
this makes possible for example to have the same feature on every page
(for example a connection service).

Eliom also make possible to write client side code in OCaml and to program
the communication between client and server.

See other tutorials for more details about all this.
