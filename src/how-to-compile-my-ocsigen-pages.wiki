=== Eliom distillery

Eliom-distillery will help you to build your client-server application
using Eliom.
It comes with several templates ("basic.ppx", "basic", "mobile",
and more to come  ...).

{{{
$ eliom-distillery -name <name> -template basic.ppx [-target-directory <dir>]
}}}

Eliom distillery will also create a default configuration file for Ocsigen
Server.

More information on Eliom distillery in
<<a_manual project="eliom" subproject="server" chapter="workflow-distillery"|Eliom's manual>>.

More information on how client-server Eliom project are compiled on
<<a_manual project="eliom" subproject="server" chapter="workflow-compilation"|this page>>.

If you don't need client-server features, the compilation process is very
simple and without surprise. Compile with {{{ocamlc}}} or {{{ocamlopt}}}
using {{{ocamlfind}}}, with package {{{eliom.server}}}.
You will have to create your configuration file manually.
But you can still use Eliom distillery, which will make easier the inclusion
of client side features, later.
