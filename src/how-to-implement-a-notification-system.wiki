=How to implement a notification system?=

If you want the user to receive notifications from the server
(for example: "you have a new message"), first create a channel, and
register it in an Eliom reference of scope {{{`Client_process}}}:
<<code language="ocaml"|
let channel_ref =
  Eliom_reference.Volatile.eref_from_fun
    ~scope:Eliom_common.default_process_scope
    (fun () -> 
       let (s, notify) = Lwt_stream.create () in
       let c = Eliom_comet.Channel.create s in
       (c, notify)
    )
>>

On client side, listen on this channel. To do that, execute this code
(on server side) during the service that will start the client process:
<<code language="ocaml"|
let (channel, _) = Eliom_reference.Volatile.get channel_ref in
let _ =
  {unit{
    Lwt.async (fun () ->
      Lwt_stream.iter_s
        (fun v -> (* do something *))
        %channel)
      }}
in
...
>>

And call function {{{notify}}} on the channel (from server side)
when you want to notify the client.

To get back the {{{notify}}} functions for one user, you may want to
[[wiki(2):manual/how-to-iterate-on-all-sessions-for-one-user-or-all-tabs|iterate on all client process states]].
To do that, create a session group for each user
(see [[wiki(2):manual/how-to-register-session-data|How to register session data]]).
Here we suppose that the session group name is the user_id, as a string.
Then iterate on all sessions from this group, and on all client processes
for each session.

For example:

<<code language="ocaml"|

let notify user_id v =
  (* We get the session group state for this user: *)
  let state =
    Eliom_state.Ext.volatile_data_group_state
      ~scope:Eliom_common.default_group_scope (Int64.to_string user_id)
  in
  (* We iterate on all sessions from the group: *)
  Eliom_state.Ext.iter_volatile_sub_states
    ~state
    (fun state ->
      (* We iterate on all client process states in the session: *)
      Eliom_state.Ext.iter_volatile_sub_states
        ~state
        (fun state ->
          let (_, notify) = Eliom_reference.Volatile.Ext.get state channel_ref in
          notify (Some v)))

//Warning://      If you do not call the iterators during
      a request or during the initialisation phase of the Eliom module,
      you must provide the extra parameter {{{?sitedata}}},
      that you can get by calling {{{Eliom_request_info.get_sitedata}}}
      during the initialisation phase of the Eliom module.
