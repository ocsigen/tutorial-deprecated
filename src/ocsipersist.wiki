=Lightweight database using Ocsipersist=
<<concepts |Persistent tables with Ocsipersist>>

For maintaining the list of user and password, we do not need the full
power of a SQL database, a key/value table is sufficient. Ocsigen has
such a simple table mechanism directly integrated: Ocsipersist.

We first create a table holding ocaml values:
<<code language="ocaml"|
let user_table = Ocsipersist.open_table "user_table"
>>

Then we can easily handle the user management code:

<<code language="ocaml"|
let check_pwd name pwd =
  try_lwt
    lwt saved_password = Ocsipersist.find user_table name in
    Lwt.return (pwd = saved_password)
  with
    Not_found -> Lwt.return false

let () = Eliom_registration.Action.register
  ~service:create_account_service
  (fun () (name, pwd) -> Ocsipersist.add user_table name pwd)

let () = Eliom_registration.Action.register
  ~service:connection_service
  (fun () (name, password) ->
    match_lwt check_pwd name password with
      | true -> Eliom_reference.set username (Some name)
      | false -> Lwt.return ())
>>

<<concept title="Ocsipersist"|
 Ocsipersist provides simple typed key/value tables. It provides different backends
 (currently sqlite and dbm) and can be extended.
 For more informations see <<a_api project="ocsigenserver"| type Ocsipersist.table >>.

== Ocsiperist and Eliom

Eliom has a higher level interface above Ocsiperist to store the server side
state of an application, called //Eliom references//.
For example persistent Eliom references of scope session group
can be used to store information about a user (if the session group
corresponds to the user).
